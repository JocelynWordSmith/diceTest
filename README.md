diceTest
========

This was a group project that was as much an exercise in understanding versioning, forking, fetching, and merging files to
and from github with multiple contributors as it was a learning experience in coding. I do 99% of my git hub activity in 
my terminal, so the learning curve was pretty steep at the time. The game itself allows the player to roll three dice, add
that score, and compare it to the score of dice rolled by the computer. It tracks how many games have been won, and uses
some simple javascript animation as well.
